Basics of React:
What is React?

Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently in response to data changes.
Explain the key features of React.

Answer: Key features of React include the use of a virtual DOM for efficient updates, the ability to create reusable components, a unidirectional data flow, and a declarative approach to building UIs.
What is JSX?

Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It allows mixing HTML-like code with JavaScript, making it easier to write and understand React components.
What is the significance of the virtual DOM in React?

Answer: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM in React. It allows React to efficiently update only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, improving performance.
Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React.

Answer: Controlled components are those whose state is controlled by React, while uncontrolled components store their own state internally.
React Components:
What is a functional component in React?

Answer: A functional component is a simpler way to write React components as functions. It receives props as parameters and returns the JSX that represents the UI.
What is a class component in React?

Answer: A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component. It can have its own state and lifecycle methods.
Explain the purpose of setState in React.

Answer: setState is a method used in React to update the state of a component. When the state changes, React re-renders the component, reflecting the updated state in the UI.
What are React hooks?

Answer: React hooks are functions that let developers use state and other React features in functional components. The most common ones are useState and useEffect.
What is the significance of the key attribute in React lists?

Answer: The key attribute is used to give a unique identity to each element in a list. It helps React efficiently update the UI by recognizing which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
State and Props:
What is the difference between state and props in React?

Answer: State is internal to a component and can be changed over time, while props are external and passed to a component. Props are immutable.
When would you use a class component over a functional component?

Answer: Class components are used when the component needs to have state, lifecycle methods, or access to this. Functional components are preferred for simplicity and when state or lifecycle methods are not needed.
How can you pass data from a parent component to a child component in React?

Answer: Data is passed from a parent to a child component using props.
Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.

Answer: Lifting state up is the process of moving the state from a child component to its parent component, allowing shared state management between components.
What is prop drilling?

Answer: Prop drilling occurs when props are passed down to multiple layers of nested child components. It can make the code harder to maintain, and in such cases, you might consider using state management tools like Redux or Context API.
React Lifecycle:
Explain the component lifecycle methods in React.

Answer: The main lifecycle methods are: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, and the static method getDerivedStateFromProps.
What is the purpose of componentDidMount in React?

Answer: componentDidMount is a lifecycle method called after a component has been rendered to the DOM. It is often used for initiating network requests or subscriptions.
What is the difference between componentDidUpdate and componentDidMount?

Answer: componentDidMount is called once after the initial render, while componentDidUpdate is called after every render, except for the initial render.
Hooks:
What is the useState hook?

Answer: useState is a hook in React that allows functional components to have state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
Explain the useEffect hook.

Answer: useEffect is a hook that allows performing side effects in functional components. It is often used for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
What is the purpose of the useContext hook?

Answer: useContext is a hook used to access the value of a context directly without wrapping a component in a Context.Consumer.
Conditional Rendering:
How can you conditionally render components in React?

Answer: Conditional rendering in React can be done using if statements, ternary operators, and logical operators. Another approach is to use the && operator or the switch statement.
What is the purpose of the map function in React?

Answer: The map function is used to iterate over an array and create a new array of React elements based on the original array.
Forms and Events:
How do you handle forms in React?

Answer: In React, you can handle forms by using controlled components, where form elements are controlled by React state.
What is event handling in React?

Answer: Event handling in React involves using synthetic events, which are React's cross-browser wrapper for the native DOM events. Handlers are typically named using the on prefix, like onClick or onChange.
Routing:
What is React Router?

Answer: React Router is a library for adding routing functionality to a React application. It enables navigation between different components, providing a seamless Single Page Application (SPA) experience.
How can you achieve client-side routing in a React application?

Answer: Client-side routing can be achieved using React Router. You define routes in your application, and React Router manages the rendering of components based on the current URL.
State Management:
What is the Context API in React?

Answer: The Context API is a way to manage state in a React application at the global level without passing props through every level of the component tree.
Explain the concept of Redux in React.

Answer: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, including React. It provides a predictable state container and helps manage the state of an entire application in a single store.
Testing:
What is Jest?
Answer: Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework, often used for testing React applications. It provides a test runner, assertion library, and

mocking utilities for testing React components and other JavaScript code.

Explain the purpose of snapshot testing in Jest.

Answer: Snapshot testing in Jest involves capturing a snapshot of the rendered output of a component and comparing it to a previously stored snapshot. It helps detect unintended changes in the UI.
What is the significance of the render method in testing React components?

Answer: The render method is used to render a React component in a testing environment. It returns a render object that allows you to interact with and assert on the rendered component.
How can you simulate user events in React tests?

Answer: User events can be simulated in React tests using the simulate method provided by testing libraries like Enzyme or the fireEvent utility provided by React Testing Library.
Performance Optimization:
What are React Pure Components?

Answer: React Pure Components are class components that implement shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow prop and state comparison. They can prevent unnecessary renders by avoiding updates when props and state haven't changed.
Explain the concept of memoization in React.

Answer: Memoization involves optimizing performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. In React, the React.memo higher-order component can be used to memoize functional components, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
These questions cover a wide range of topics related to React.js, including the basics, components, state and props, hooks, lifecycle methods, conditional rendering, forms and events, routing, state management, testing, and performance optimization. Depending on the specific role or project requirements, you may encounter additional questions related to specific React libraries, tools, or best practices.

Advanced React Concepts:
What is the significance of the useReducer hook?

Answer: useReducer is a hook in React that is used for state management. It is an alternative to useState and is particularly useful when the next state depends on the previous state and when dealing with complex state logic.
Explain the concept of React Portals.

Answer: React Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This is useful for scenarios like modals, tooltips, and overlays.
What are Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React?

Answer: Higher Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality. They are a way to reuse component logic and share code between components.
Redux:
What are actions and reducers in the context of Redux?

Answer: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the application state. Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to these actions.
Explain the purpose of middleware in Redux.

Answer: Middleware in Redux provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. It can be used for logging, async operations, and other side effects.
What is the difference between mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?

Answer: mapStateToProps is a function that connects a part of the Redux state to the props of a React component, while mapDispatchToProps is a function that connects Redux actions to the props of a React component.
React Hooks:
What are custom hooks in React?

Answer: Custom hooks are functions that use React hooks and can be shared across components to encapsulate and reuse logic. They often start with the word "use" to indicate that they follow the hook conventions.
Explain the use of the useContext hook with examples.

Answer: useContext is a hook that allows functional components to consume values from a React context. It is used to avoid prop drilling by providing a way to access global state.
Advanced Testing:
What is Mocking in Jest?

Answer: Mocking in Jest involves replacing a module's dependencies with mock functions. It is commonly used to isolate the code being tested and control the behavior of functions.
How can you test asynchronous code in React?

Answer: Asynchronous code in React can be tested using Jest's async/await syntax or by returning a promise from the test and using the then method.
React Router:
What is the purpose of React Router's Link component?

Answer: The Link component in React Router is used to navigate between pages or components. It renders an anchor tag (<a>) with a special behavior to prevent the browser from performing a full page reload.
Explain the difference between BrowserRouter and HashRouter in React Router.

Answer: BrowserRouter uses the HTML5 history API for clean URLs, while HashRouter uses the URL hash to manage navigation. BrowserRouter requires server-side configuration for non-root routes, while HashRouter works out of the box.
Performance Optimization:
What are React Memo and useMemo?

Answer: React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component to prevent unnecessary renders. useMemo is a hook that memoizes the result of a function, allowing for performance optimization by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
Explain the concept of code splitting in React.

Answer: Code splitting is the process of breaking the code into smaller chunks and loading them on demand. In React, this can be achieved using dynamic imports or tools like React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when they are needed.
Styling in React:
What are the different ways to style a React component?
Answer: React components can be styled using plain CSS, pre-processors like Sass or Less, CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, or by using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
