What is MongoDB?

Answer: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability, flexibility, and high performance.
Explain the key features of MongoDB.

Answer: MongoDB features include document-based storage, dynamic schema, support for indexing, replication for high availability, and horizontal scaling through sharding.
What is BSON in MongoDB?

Answer: BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents used by MongoDB. It allows efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Documents and Collections:
What is a document in MongoDB?

Answer: A document in MongoDB is a record that consists of key-value pairs. It is analogous to a row in a relational database table.
What is a collection in MongoDB?

Answer: A collection in MongoDB is a grouping of MongoDB documents. It is similar to a table in a relational database, but it doesn't enforce a schema.
Querying in MongoDB:
Explain the find() method in MongoDB.

Answer: The find() method in MongoDB is used to query documents from a collection. It can include criteria for filtering, sorting, and limiting the results.
What is the purpose of the findOne() method in MongoDB?

Answer: The findOne() method is used to retrieve a single document that matches the specified criteria. It is often used when you expect only one result.
How can you perform a projection in MongoDB?

Answer: Projection in MongoDB involves limiting the fields returned in a query. It is done by passing a second argument to find() or findOne() with the fields to include or exclude.
Indexing and Performance:
Why is indexing important in MongoDB?

Answer: Indexing in MongoDB improves the speed of query execution by creating a data structure that allows the database to find and retrieve data more quickly.
How do you create an index in MongoDB?

Answer: You can create an index in MongoDB using the createIndex() method. For example: db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 }) creates an ascending index on the specified field.
Aggregation Framework:
What is the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB?

Answer: The Aggregation Framework is a powerful tool in MongoDB for performing data transformation operations on the data stored in collections. It allows users to process data and return computed results.
Explain the concept of pipelines in the Aggregation Framework.

Answer: Pipelines in the Aggregation Framework are sequences of data processing stages. Each stage in the pipeline transforms the documents as they pass through, enabling complex data manipulations.
CRUD Operations:
How can you insert documents in MongoDB?

Answer: Documents can be inserted in MongoDB using the insertOne() or insertMany() methods. For example: db.collection.insertOne({ field: value }).
Explain how to update documents in MongoDB.

Answer: Updating documents in MongoDB can be done using the updateOne() or updateMany() methods. The $set operator is often used to specify the fields to update.
What is the purpose of the remove() method in MongoDB?

Answer: The remove() method in MongoDB is used to delete documents from a collection based on specified criteria.
Data Modeling:
What is normalization in MongoDB?

Answer: Normalization in MongoDB involves designing the database schema to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing data into separate collections.
Explain denormalization in MongoDB.

Answer: Denormalization in MongoDB involves duplicating data in multiple documents or collections to optimize read performance and simplify query complexity.
Transactions:
Does MongoDB support transactions?
Answer: Yes, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions starting from version 4.0. Transactions provide atomicity and consistency for operations involving multiple documents.
Security and Authentication:
How can you secure MongoDB?

Answer: MongoDB can be secured by using authentication, setting up access control, enabling encryption, and regularly updating and patching the MongoDB server.
Explain the role of roles in MongoDB security.

Answer: Roles in MongoDB define the privileges granted to users. They control a user's access to databases and operations within those databases.
Sharding:
What is sharding in MongoDB?

Answer: Sharding is the process of splitting a large dataset across multiple servers to improve performance and horizontal scalability.
How do you enable sharding in MongoDB?

Answer: Sharding is enabled by choosing a shard key and running the sh.enableSharding() command on the database. Subsequently, collections can be sharded using sh.shardCollection().
Backup and Restoration:
How can you perform a backup in MongoDB?

Answer: MongoDB backups can be performed using tools like mongodump or by using file system snapshots. For example: mongodump --out /path/to/backup.
Explain the process of restoring a MongoDB backup.

Answer: MongoDB backups can be restored using the mongorestore tool. For example: mongorestore /path/to/backup.
Replication:
What is replication in MongoDB?

Answer: Replication in MongoDB involves maintaining multiple copies of data to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It consists of a primary node and one or more secondary nodes.
How do you set up replication in MongoDB?

Answer: Replication is set up by configuring a MongoDB replica set. This involves starting multiple MongoDB instances, specifying the replica set configuration, and initiating the replica set.
Scaling:
What is vertical scaling in MongoDB?

Answer: Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources, such as CPU, RAM, or storage.
Explain horizontal scaling in MongoDB.

Answer: Horizontal scaling involves distributing data across multiple servers to handle larger amounts of traffic and data. In MongoDB, this is achieved through sharding.
GeoSpatial Indexing:
What is GeoSpatial Indexing in MongoDB?

Answer: GeoSpatial Indexing in MongoDB allows the storage and retrieval of geospatial data. It supports queries that involve the proximity of objects on the Earth's surface.
How do you create a GeoSpatial Index in MongoDB?

Answer: A GeoSpatial Index in MongoDB is created using the createIndex() method with a 2dsphere index type. For example: db.collection.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" }).
